                            on the quality,

                        <li>“Best Value” is the default sort order for hotels and ranks these establishments using
                            exclusive Tripadvisor data, including confirmed availability from our partners,
                            booking popularity as reported to us by our partners, traveler ratings, prices, location,
                            personal user preferences and hotel browsing history.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>"Tripadvisor Sort" is the default sort order, and ranks vacation rental property listings
                            based on (in order of importance from least to most) the property’s overall traveler rating,
                            number of times the listing has been viewed, and the<b>revenue made by Tripadvisor companies
                                from bookings made through our sites.</b> For all other sort orders with the exception
                            of Traveler Rating, the Tripadvisor Sort also works as a “tie-breaker” to determine ordering
                            where there are two or more properties with the same attributes.

                        </li>
                        <li>“Price (Low to high/ High to low)”: ranks properties based on price on the dates searched.

                        <li>“Bedrooms (Most to least/ Least to most)”: ranks properties based on the number of bedrooms,

                    <ul>

                    <p><b>Search:</b> Tripadvisor’s internal search function presents results relevant to your text
                        query. To give you the most useful information, search algorithms look at many factors and
                        signals, including the words of your query, reviews, bubble rating, number of page views, and
                        your location. Different result types can have different factors relevant to them, but the text
                        query is applied to rank all the results on the search page. Apart from the query, the following
                        factors are used to order the search results, depending on the type of Tripadvisor content
                        discovered by the search:</p>
                    <ul>

                    <p><b>AI-powered Trips</b></p>
                    <p>Tripadvisor’s AI-powered trip itinerary builder creates lists of suggestions for a potential
                        trip. The tool suggests destinations based on similar searches by users from the user’s home
                        location. The suggested interests, from which travelers can select, are a mix of generic topics
                        and topics selected by AI as being particularly relevant for the destination. Then, taking the
                        user’s selected destination, dates and interests, the trip tool suggests accommodations, things
                        to do and restaurants to visit. Where options for bookable Things to Do products are shown, they
                        may also be selected partially due to the revenue they are likely to generate for Tripadvisor.
                    </p>
                    <p>Options for accommodations will be shown according to the Best Value sort, which is described
                        above under<b> Hotels.</b></p>
                    <p>The itinerary produced by the tool then lists restaurants, places of interest and things to do
                        based on review scores in our Popularity Index and proximity to other recommendations in the
                        list. Bookable Things to do may also appear partly due to the revenue they are likely to
                        generate for Tripadvisor. The descriptions are generated by AI, drawing on content from user
                        reviews.</p>
                    <p>AI is not perfect and the Trip planner’s suggestions are only intended as a starting point for a
                        user’s booking journey. Travelers should continue their own research and keep reading user
                        reviews and other available information before booking.</p>

                        account via the Trips page. Our Trips section also features a “For you” page bearing further
                        suggestions. Where suggestions are described as being “top ranked”, this is a reference to the
                        following sort logics, all of which are explained above:</p>
                    <p>Hotels - Best Value</p>
                    <p>Things to Do – Traveller Favourites </p>
                    <p>Restaurants - Highest Rating</p>
                    <p><b>Traveler's Choice</b></p>
                    <p>Tripadvisor’s awards fall into two levels: Best of the Best and Travelers’ Choice.</p>
                    <p>Travelers’ Choice Best of the Best is our highest honor. The award takes into account the quality
                        and quantity of traveler reviews and ratings, and ranks the very best accommodations,
                        destinations, beaches, restaurants, and things to do in specific categories and geographic
                        areas, as rated and reviewed by travelers. Travelers’ Choice Best of the Best award winners are
                        among the top 1% of listings on Tripadvisor.</p>
                    <p>Travelers’ Choice, formerly Certificate of Excellence, recognizes businesses that earn
                        consistently great reviews. Travelers’ Choice award-winners are among the top 10% of listings on
                        Tripadvisor. Tripadvisor Travelers’ Choice honors select accommodations, attractions and
                        restaurants that consistently demonstrate a commitment to hospitality excellence. On destination
                        pages, these winners are ranked using Tripadvisor data including reviews, ratings and number of
                        page views.</p>

                    <h2 class="tieude">3. No ownership of any listed businesses</h2>
                    <p>Tripadvisor does not own any of the businesses listed on its site.</p>
                    <p>See <a href="">here</a> the list of websites managed and operated by Tripadvisor and/or its
                        affiliate companies.</p>

                    <h2 class="tieude">4. Compensation</h2>
                    <p>Except where described above, travel and hospitality businesses are listed on Tripadvisor for
                        free.</p>
                    <p>Where price offers are provided for hotels, the ranking of price offers may depend in part on the
                        price paid by affiliates who participate in our "cost-per-click" auction system.</p>
                    <p>Suppliers of tours, activities and experiences can be listed on Tripadvisor for free. If they
                        wish to make a tour, activity or experience bookable through Tripadvisor or its affiliate
                        companies, they must enter into an agreement with one of Tripadvisor’s affiliate companies,
                        pursuant to which the suppliers are paid for bookings made through our platforms.</p>
                    <p>Some vacation rental property owners/managers advertise through Tripadvisor’s affiliate companies
                        on a fixed cost subscription basis, and others pay for leads generated through their Tripadvisor
                        listings. Some listings may appear on Tripadvisor as a result of licensing agreements with third
                        party businesses who may charge us a fee for referring interested users to their websites to
                        make bookings. The majority of advertisers, however, list their properties for free, and pay a
                        commission when bookings are facilitated by the online platforms offered by the vacation rentals
                        companies in our corporate group.</p>
                    <p>Airlines are listed on Tripadvisor for free. Tripadvisor does not accept any compensation that
                        could influence the rankings of flight for a given user search, as described above.</p>
                    <h2 class="tieude">5. Commercial Relations</h2>
                    <p>Partners can enter into a number of different kinds of direct commercial relationship with
                        Tripadvisor if they wish, especially in order to be bookable online. Commercial relationships
                        that partners may have with Tripadvisor may influence certain ranking methods as described
                        above. However, they have no influence on Tripadvisor’s <a href="">'Popularity Index'.</a></p>
                    <p>Although Sponsored Placements may appear in and around a list of results, partners cannot buy
                        their way to a particular place in any of the ranking methods described above. The advertising
                        nature of these placements referenced for a fee is indicated by the label "Ad" or “Sponsored”.

                    <p><b>Hotels</b></p>
                    <p>Tripadvisor gives you the ability to search for and compare hotels, as well as availability and
                        pricing offered by professional third-party providers.</p>
                    <p>The results displayed are not exhaustive of all the offers available on the Internet. Tripadvisor

                        on its sites or applications, or content on other websites. The ranking of price offers for a
                        particular property will depend in part on the price paid by our advertising partners
                        participating in our "cost-per-click" auction system.</p>
                    <p>If you make a reservation with a third-party provider, you will need to read and comply with the
                        terms and conditions of purchase and use of the provider's site, their Privacy Policy and any
                        other rules or policies, including the policy relating to the site or the goods of the supplier.

                        dates into our search function for that particular home (assuming that this business works with
                        us or one of our business partners), our systems make an electronic "call" on the programming
                        interface of application (API) provided by this trading partner. The partner then automatically
                        gives us the relevant price information in real time, if there is availability.</p>

                        currency. Consult our partners to find out more about the elements of the price included baggage
                        fees, fare attributes and optional fees as well.</p>
                    <p>The price results that consumers see on Tripadvisor are provided by our business partners in real

                    <p><b>Vacation Rentals and Things to Do</b></p>
                    <p>For vacation rentals and attractions booked on our site, the price payable is the total price,
                        inclusive of taxes and fees. Prices are provided in real time for each search conducted by a
                        user.</p>
                    <p>For vacation rentals, our vacation rental-related affiliate companies offer a <a href="">payment
                            protection </a>policy, giving guests extra peace of mind when booking a rental through them.
                        It means that, subject to the terms of the policy, a guest will be offered a refund for their
                        stay if they are denied access to the property, or if the property is misrepresented (differing
                        substantially to what was advertised), or as otherwise covered under the terms of the policy.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, not all vacation rental properties listed on the site are offered by our vacation
                        rental-related affiliate companies. Some are presented by third-party companies advertising
                        their inventory on our site. These are presented differently on the site. The payment protection
                        policy referred to above will not apply in these cases. Please consult the third-party vacation
                        rental property for terms and conditions.</p>
                    <p>For more information, please see our vacation rental-related affiliate companies’ <a

                    <p>None of the Tripadvisor companies offers any commercial guarantees. If you book a hotel,
                        restaurant or flight, you should consult our partners to find out more about any commercial
                        guarantees and dispute resolution methods they may offer. If you book a vacation rental property
                        or a tour, activity or experience via the intermediary services of one of our group companies,
                        the applicable Tripadvisor group company that facilitated your booking will provide you with
                        customer service in the event of a dispute, and will work with the owner of the property or
                        supplier of the tour, activity or experience to help the parties try to reach a resolution.
                        Where you make a booking facilitated by a third-party company outside of our group, that company
                        will provide you with customer service.</p>

                    <h2 class="tieude">8. Main features of review moderation</h2>
                    <p>Before being posted to our site, each review goes through our automated processing system, which
                        collects for each review a certain amount of information answering the following questions: how,
                        what, where and when. If the system detects an element in clear contradiction to our <a
                            href="">Content & Community Guidelines</a>, the review will not be posted to the site. The
                        user may be informed as well as the reason for this and may be offered the opportunity to write
                        another review in accordance with our Guidelines, depending on eligibility.</p>
                    <p>When the system detects a potential problem with a review, it is sent to our team of content
                        specialists, who work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to maintain the quality of content posted to
                        our site. </p>
                    <p>In some cases, we will also send an e-mail asking users to validate their review before it is
                        posted. In certain circumstances (for example, if an owner/manager disputes a review), we might
                        ask the reviewer of a vacation rental property to provide us with proof of their stay, to ensure
                        that the review is attached to the correct property listing.</p>
                    <p>Our team checks every review that is reported to us by our community (both businesses and users)
                        as potentially not meeting our Guidelines.</p>
                    <p>For more information on our anti-fraud policy please refer to our <a href="">Trust & Safety
                            information center</a>.</p>
                    <h2 class="tieude">9. Our criteria for hosting traveler reviews</h2>
                    <p>We want to ensure that Tripadvisor remains a reliable and secure source for our global community.
                        For this purpose, and to ensure that your review is posted as quickly as possible, make sure
                        that it meets our <a href=""> Content & Community Guidelines. </a></p>
                    <p>For reviews of vacation rental properties, there are additional criteria listed <a
                            href="">here</a>. In summary, vacation rental reviews must also be:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>based on short-term stays,</li>
                        <li>written after check-in,</li>
                        <li>verifiable by the name on the rental contract, and</li>
                        <li>written in relation to stays that can be evidenced by the reviewer.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Any review that does not meet these <a href="">criteria</a> will not appear on the site.</p>
                    <p>If you have a question about a review that has not been posted, you can contact us directly by
                        clicking on the link <a href="">here</a>.</p>
                    <h2 class="tieude">10. When will my review appear on the site?</h2>
                    <p>It usually takes less than 24 hours to see reviews on our site. The process can be longer if the
                        review needs to be examined in more detail by our team of moderators. It may also take longer if
                        you review a vacation rental property that you booked through Tripadvisor or one of our
                        affiliate company’s online platforms. See <a href="">here</a> for more info. </p>

                    <p>After submitting, the title of your review appears in your profile, on the <a href=""> Review
                            page</a>.</p>
                    <p>If we are unable to host your review, you may be notified of the refusal and the reason for this.
                        Please note that in some cases, we will also send you an e-mail asking you to validate your
                        review before it can appear. You just have to click on the link provided in the e-mail.</p>
                    <h2 class="tieude">11. How long will my review appear?</h2>
                    <p>Once posted, your review will appear indefinitely on our site. Your review will only be removed if:</p>
                    <p>1) You choose to <a href=""> remove it</a></p>
                    <p>2) our team of moderators has determined that this review did not meet our <a href="">Guidelines</a>.</p>
                    <p>3) You fail to click on the link contained with an email asking you to validate your review, as outlined above</p>
                    <p>4) an establishment is removed from our site, in which case all reviews are removed.</p>
                    <p>5) An establishment goes through an ownership change or major renovation and reviews prior to a certain date that are no longer relevant are removed</p>
                    <h2 class="tieude">12. Can I be rewarded for a review?</h2>
                    <p>No. Reviews written in exchange for personal benefits, such as gifts, services or money, will be removed.</p>
                    <p>Establishments are free to encourage their clients to post their reviews when they return home. However, no representative of the establishment can offer premium, discount, upgrade or special treatment for current or future stays in exchange for advice. Properties making such offers may have their rankings penalized.</p>
                    <p>If someone has offered you a reward for a review, please let us know by emailing us and including any available evidence (screenshots, photos, etc) at <a href="">incentives@tripadvisor.com</a></p>
                    <h2 class="tieude">13. Is it possible to modify a review?</h2>
                    <p>No, Once submitted, your review can not be edited. You can <a href="">remove your review</a>and resubmit as long as it complies with our <a href="">posting guidelines</a>.</p>
                    <h2 class="tieude">14. Will my review appear on other websites or publications?</h2>
                    <p>After being posted, all or part of the reviews written by our members may be used on some of our partner sites or in promotional materials generally.</p>
                    <p>For more information, read our <a href="">Terms of Use</a> and our <a href="">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
                    <h2 class="tieude">15. If I write a review about an establishment, can I be contacted about it?</h2>
                    <p>Sharing a contributor's e-mail address to an owner, manager, or other person is against our privacy policy. Contributors remain anonymous unless they choose to publish their email address or contact information in a contribution, such as a review or message in a forum.</p>
                    <p>However, property owners or managers may contact you through Tripadvisor's private messaging  system, which allows Tripadvisor members to be in contact without providing an email address. Owners can use the messaging system to thank contributors, ask for other comments, legitimately attempt to resolve customer service issues, or (in the case of vacation rental property owners or managers) discuss a booking with a user, but they are not allowed to ask contributors to retract a review via the mailing system. It is also strictly forbidden to harass contributors.</p>
                    <p>For more information, see our <a href=""> rules </a>for using private messaging.</p>
